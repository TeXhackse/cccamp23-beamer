# cccamp23-beamer
(Un)official beamer theme for [Chaos Communication Camp 2023](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2023)

It's still a draft and may get some updates.

It uses the official Design Templates privided by [Veith YÃ¤ger Sedivy](https://veith-yaeger.de/) which can be found on https://events.ccc.de/camp/2023/infos/styleguide.html

## Fonts
The easiest way to access the fonts is installing them as System Fonts. 

## Usage
Please ensure you are using a recent TeX Distribution. It works on both, MikTeX as well as TeX Live, but due to simplification with LaTeX3-mechanism outdated Versions will throw errors, as mentioned in #1.

For detailed information see the demonstration file.
